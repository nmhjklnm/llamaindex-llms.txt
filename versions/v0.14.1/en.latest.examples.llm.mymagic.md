# MyMagic AI LLM¶
## Introduction¶
This notebook demonstrates how to use MyMagicAI for batch inference on massive data stored in cloud buckets. The only enpoints implemented are `complete` and `acomplete` which can work on many use cases including Completion, Summariation and Extraction. To use this notebook, you need an API key (Personal Access Token) from MyMagicAI and data stored in cloud buckets. Sign up by clicking Get Started at MyMagicAI's website to get your API key.
## Setup¶
To set up your bucket and grant MyMagic API a secure access to your cloud storage, please visit MyMagic docs for reference. If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

Note: if return_output is set True above, max_tokens should be set to at least 100

print(resp)

## Asynchronous Requests by using `acomplete` endpoint¶
For asynchronous operations, use the following approach.

```
async def main():
    response = await llm.acomplete(
        question="your-question",
        model="choose-model",  # supported models constantly updated and are listed at docs.mymagic.ai
        max_tokens=5,  # number of tokens to generate, default is 10
    )

    print("Async completion response:", response)

```

async def main(): response = await llm.acomplete( question="your-question", model="choose-model", # supported models constantly updated and are listed at docs.mymagic.ai max_tokens=5, # number of tokens to generate, default is 10 ) print("Async completion response:", response)
