# FlagEmbeddingReranker
![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)
Rerank can speed up an LLM query without sacrificing accuracy (and in fact, probably improving it). It does so by pruning away irrelevant nodes from the context.
If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

The author applied to three grad schools: MIT, Yale, and Harvard. The reason for applying to these schools was because they were renowned for AI at the time and the author wanted to pursue a career in artificial intelligence.

The author applied to three grad schools: MIT, Yale, and Harvard. They chose these schools based on their strong reputations in the field of AI at the time. Additionally, Harvard was appealing because it was where Bill Woods, the inventor of the parser used in the author's SHRDLU clone, was located.

As we can see, the query engine with reranking produced a much more concise output in much lower time (6s v.s. 10s). While both responses were essentially correct, the query engine without reranking included a lot of irrelevant information - a phenomenon we could attribute to "pollution of the context window".
