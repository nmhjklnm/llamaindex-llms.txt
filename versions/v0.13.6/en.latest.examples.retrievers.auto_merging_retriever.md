# Auto Merging Retriever¶
In this notebook, we showcase our `AutoMergingRetriever`, which looks at a set of leaf nodes and recursively "merges" subsets of leaf nodes that reference a parent node beyond a given threshold. This allows us to consolidate potentially disparate, smaller contexts into a larger context that might help synthesis.
You can define this hierarchy yourself over a set of documents, or you can make use of our brand-new text parser: a HierarchicalNodeParser that takes in a candidate set of documents and outputs an entire hierarchy of nodes, from "coarse-to-fine".

## Load Data¶
Let's first load the Llama 2 paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09288.pdf. This will be our test data.
In [ ]:

```
!mkdir -p 'data/'
!wget --user-agent "Mozilla" "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09288.pdf" -O "data/llama2.pdf"

loader = PyMuPDFReader() # docs0 = loader.load_data(file=Path("./data/llama2.pdf")) docs0 = loader.load(file_path=Path("./data/llama2.pdf"))
By default, the PDF reader creates a separate doc for each page. For the sake of this notebook, we stitch docs together into one doc. This will help us better highlight auto-merging capabilities that "stitch" chunks together later on.

## Parse Chunk Hierarchy from Text, Load into Storage¶
In this section we make use of the `HierarchicalNodeParser`. This will output a hierarchy of nodes, from top-level nodes with bigger chunk sizes to child nodes with smaller chunk sizes, where each child node has a parent node with a bigger chunk size.
By default, the hierarchy is:
  * 1st level: chunk size 2048
  * 2nd level: chunk size 512
  * 3rd level: chunk size 128


We then load these nodes into storage. The leaf nodes are indexed and retrieved via a vector store - these are the nodes that will first be directly retrieved via similarity search. The other nodes will be retrieved from a docstore.

**Text:** We also list two qualitative examples where safety and helpfulness reward models don’t agree with each other in Table 35. A.4.2 Qualitative Results on Safety Data Scaling In Section 4.2.3, we study the impact of adding more safety data into model RLHF in a quantitative manner. Here we showcase a few samples to qualitatively examine the evolution of model behavior when we scale safety data in Tables 36, 37, and 38. In general, we are observing that Llama 2-Chat becomes safer responding to unsafe prompts with more safety data used.

**Similarity:** 0.86168727941324  
**Text:** We conduct RLHF by first collecting human preference data for safety similar to Section 3.2.2: annotators write a prompt that they believe can elicit unsafe behavior, and then compare multiple model responses to the prompts, selecting the response that is safest according to a set of guidelines. We then use the human preference data to train a safety reward model (see Section 3.2.2), and also reuse the adversarial prompts to sample from the model during the RLHF stage. Better Long-Tail Safety Robustness without Hurting Helpfulness Safety is inherently a long-tail problem, where the challenge comes from a small number of very specific cases. We investigate the impact of Safety RLHF by taking two intermediate Llama 2-Chat checkpoints—one without adversarial prompts in the RLHF stage and one with them—and score their responses on our test sets using our safety and helpfulness reward models. In Figure 14, we plot the score distribution shift of the safety RM on the safety test set (left) and that of the helpfulness RM on the helpfulness test set (right). In the left hand side of the figure, we observe that the distribution of safety RM scores on the safety set shifts to higher reward scores after safety tuning with RLHF, and that the long tail of the distribution near zero thins out. A clear cluster appears on the top-left corner suggesting the improvements of model safety. On the right side, we do not observe any gathering pattern below the y = x line on the right hand side of Figure 14, which indicates that the helpfulness score distribution is preserved after safety tuning with RLHF. Put another way, given sufficient helpfulness training data, the addition of an additional stage of safety mitigation does not negatively impact model performance on helpfulness to any notable degradation. A qualitative example is shown in Table 12. Impact of Safety Data Scaling. A tension between helpfulness and safety of LLMs has been observed in previous studies (Bai et al., 2022a). To better understand how the addition of safety training data affects general model performance, especially helpfulness, we investigate the trends in safety data scaling by adjusting the amount of safety data used in the RLHF stage.

Adjusting the amount of safety data used in the RLHF stage could potentially have the following outcomes:
1. Improved model safety: Increasing the amount of safety data used in RLHF may lead to improvements in model safety. This means that the model becomes better at responding to unsafe prompts and avoids generating unsafe or harmful outputs.
2. Thinning out of the long tail of safety RM scores: Increasing the amount of safety data may result in a shift in the distribution of safety reward model (RM) scores towards higher reward scores. This means that the model becomes more consistent in generating safe responses and reduces the occurrence of low safety scores.
3. Preservation of helpfulness performance: Adjusting the amount of safety data used in RLHF is not expected to negatively impact model performance on helpfulness. This means that the model's ability to generate helpful responses is maintained even after incorporating additional safety training.
4. Gathering pattern in helpfulness RM scores: There is no observed gathering pattern below the y = x line in the distribution of helpfulness RM scores after safety tuning with RLHF. This suggests that the helpfulness score distribution is preserved, indicating that the model's helpfulness performance is not significantly degraded by the addition of safety mitigation measures.
Overall, adjusting the amount of safety data used in the RLHF stage aims to strike a balance between improving model safety without compromising its helpfulness performance.

Adjusting the amount of safety data used in the RLHF stage could potentially lead to improvements in model safety. This can be observed by a clear cluster appearing on the top-left corner, suggesting enhanced model safety. Additionally, it is indicated that the helpfulness score distribution is preserved after safety tuning with RLHF, indicating that the addition of safety data does not negatively impact model performance on helpfulness.

## Evaluation¶
We evaluate how well the hierarchical retriever works compared to the baseline retriever in a more quantitative manner.
