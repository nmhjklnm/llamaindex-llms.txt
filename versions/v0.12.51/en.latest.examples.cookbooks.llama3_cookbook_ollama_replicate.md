# Llama3 Cookbook with Ollama and Replicate¶
![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)
Meta developed and released the Meta Llama 3 family of large language models (LLMs), a collection of pretrained and instruction tuned generative text models in 8 and 70B sizes. The Llama 3 instruction tuned models are optimized for dialogue use cases and outperform many of the available open source chat models on common industry benchmarks.
In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use Llama3 with LlamaIndex for a comprehensive set of use cases.
  1. Basic completion / chat
  2. Basic RAG (Vector Search, Summarization)
  3. Advanced RAG (Routing, Sub-Questions)
  4. Text-to-SQL
  5. Structured Data Extraction
  6. Chat Engine + Memory
  7. Agents


We use Llama3-8B through Ollama, and Llama3-70B through Replicate.

## 1. Basic Completion and Chat¶
### Call complete with a prompt¶

```
response = llm.complete("do you like drake or kendrick better?")

print(response)

```

response = llm.complete("do you like drake or kendrick better?") print(response)
```
I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences or opinions, nor can I listen to music. I exist solely to provide information and assist with tasks, so I don't have the capacity to enjoy or compare different artists' music. Both Drake and Kendrick Lamar are highly acclaimed rappers, and it's subjective which one you might prefer based on your individual tastes in music.

```

In [ ]:
Copied!
```
stream_response = llm.stream_complete(
    "you're a drake fan. tell me why you like drake more than kendrick"
)

for t in stream_response:
    print(t.delta, end="")

```

stream_response = llm.stream_complete( "you're a drake fan. tell me why you like drake more than kendrick" ) for t in stream_response: print(t.delta, end="")
```
As a hypothetical Drake fan, I'd say that there are several reasons why I might prefer his music over Kendrick's. Here are a few possible reasons:

1. **Lyrical storytelling**: Drake is known for his vivid storytelling on tracks like "Marvins Room" and "Take Care." He has a way of painting pictures with his words, making listeners feel like they're right there with him, experiencing the highs and lows he's singing about. Kendrick, while also an incredible storyteller, might not have the same level of lyrical detail that Drake does.
2. **Melodic flow**: Drake's melodic flow is infectious! He has a way of crafting hooks and choruses that get stuck in your head, making it hard to stop listening. Kendrick's flows are often more complex and intricate, but Drake's simplicity can be just as effective in getting the job done.
3. **Vulnerability**: Drake isn't afraid to show his vulnerable side on tracks like "Hold On" and "I'm Upset." He wears his heart on his sleeve, sharing personal struggles and emotions with listeners. This vulnerability makes him relatable and easier to connect with on a deeper level.
4. **Production**: Drake has had the privilege of working with some incredible producers (like Noah "40" Shebib and Boi-1da) who bring out the best in him. The way he incorporates these sounds into his songs is often seamless, creating a unique blend of hip-hop and R&B that's hard to resist.
5. **Cultural relevance**: As someone who grew up in Toronto, Drake has a deep understanding of the Canadian experience and the struggles that come with it. He often references his hometown and the people he grew up around, giving his music a distinctly Canadian flavor. This cultural relevance makes his music feel more authentic and connected to the world we live in.
6. **Commercial appeal**: Let's face it – Drake has a knack for creating hits! His songs are often catchy, radio-friendly, and designed to get stuck in your head. While Kendrick might not have the same level of commercial success, Drake's ability to craft songs that resonate with a wider audience is undeniable.

Of course, this is all just hypothetical – as a fan, I can appreciate both artists for their unique strengths and styles! What do you think?

## 2. Basic RAG (Vector Search, Summarization)¶
### Basic RAG (Vector Search)¶
In [ ]:
Copied!
```
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex

index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(docs_both)
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(similarity_top_k=3)

```

from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(docs_both) query_engine = index.as_query_engine(similarity_top_k=3)
In [ ]:
Copied!
```
response = query_engine.query("Tell me about family matters")

```

response = query_engine.query("Tell me about family matters")
In [ ]:
Copied!
```
print(str(response))

```

print(str(response))
```
According to the provided context, "Family Matters" is a seven-and-a-half-minute diss track by Drake in response to Kendrick Lamar's disses against him. The song has three different beats and features several shots at Kendrick, as well as other members of Drake's entourage, including A$AP Rocky and The Weeknd. In the song, Drake raps about his personal life, including his relationships with Rihanna and Whitney Alford, and even makes allegations about Kendrick's domestic life.

```

### Basic RAG (Summarization)¶
In [ ]:
Copied!
```
from llama_index.core import SummaryIndex

summary_index = SummaryIndex.from_documents(docs_both)
summary_engine = summary_index.as_query_engine()

```

from llama_index.core import SummaryIndex summary_index = SummaryIndex.from_documents(docs_both) summary_engine = summary_index.as_query_engine()
In [ ]:
Copied!
```
response = summary_engine.query(
    "Given your assessment of this article, who won the beef?"
)

```

response = summary_engine.query( "Given your assessment of this article, who won the beef?" )
In [ ]:
Copied!
```
print(str(response))

```

print(str(response))
```
**Repeat**

The article does not provide a clear verdict on who "won" the beef, nor does it suggest that the conflict has been definitively resolved. Instead, it presents the situation as ongoing and multifaceted, with both artists continuing to engage in a game of verbal sparring and lyrical one-upmanship.

```

## 3. Advanced RAG (Routing, Sub-Questions)¶
### Build a Router that can choose whether to do vector search or summarization¶

    ),

    "Tell me about the song meet the grahams - why is it significant"
)

```

from llama_index.core.query_engine import RouterQueryEngine query_engine = RouterQueryEngine.from_defaults( [vector_tool, summary_tool], select_multi=False, verbose=True ) response = query_engine.query( "Tell me about the song meet the grahams - why is it significant" )
```

```

In [ ]:
Copied!
```
print(response)

```

print(response)
```
"Meet the Grahams" artwork is a crucial part of a larger strategy by Kendrick Lamar to address Drake's family matters in a diss track. The artwork shows a pair of Maybach gloves, a shirt, receipts, and prescription bottles, including one for Ozempic prescribed to Drake. This song is significant because it serves as the full picture that Kendrick teased earlier on "6.16 in LA" and addresses all members of Drake's family, including his son Adonis, mother Sandi, father Dennis, and an alleged 11-year-old daughter. The song takes it to the point of no return, with Kendrick musing that he wishes Dennis Graham wore a condom the night Drake was conceived and telling both Drake's parents that they raised a man whose house is due to be raided any day now on Harvey Weinstein-level allegations.

## 5. Structured Data Extraction¶
An important use case for function calling is extracting structured objects. LlamaIndex provides an intuitive interface for this through `structured_predict` - simply define the target Pydantic class (can be nested), and given a prompt, we extract out the desired object.
**NOTE** : Since there's no native function calling support with Llama3 / Ollama, the structured extraction is performed by prompting the LLM + output parsing.

## 6. Adding Chat History to RAG (Chat Engine)¶
In this section we create a stateful chatbot from a RAG pipeline, with our chat engine abstraction.
Unlike a stateless query engine, the chat engine maintains conversation history (through a memory module like buffer memory). It performs retrieval given a condensed question, and feeds the condensed question + context + chat history into the final LLM prompt.

Kendrick Lamar's contributions to the beef!

According to the article, Kendrick released several diss tracks in response to Drake's initial shots. One notable track is "Not Like Us", which directly addresses Drake and his perceived shortcomings.

However, the article highlights that Kendrick's most significant response was his album "Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers", which features several tracks that can be seen as indirect disses towards Drake.

The article also mentions that Kendrick's family has been a target of Drake's attacks, with Drake referencing Kendrick's estranged relationship with his partner Whitney and their two kids (one of whom is allegedly fathered by Dave Free).

It's worth noting that Kendrick didn't directly respond to Drake's THP6 track. Instead, he focused on his own music and let the lyrics speak for themselves.

Overall, Kendrick's approach was more subtle yet still packed a punch, showcasing his storytelling ability and lyrical prowess.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific tracks or moments from the beef?

Thought: The current language of the user is: English. I need to use a tool to help me answer the question.
Action: kendrick_search
Action Input: {'input': "Kendrick Lamar's childhood"}
Observation: Kendrick Lamar was born on June 17, 1987, in Compton, California. He is the first child of Kenneth "Kenny" Duckworth, a former gang hustler who previously worked at KFC, and Paula Oliver, a hairdresser who previously worked at McDonald's. Both of his parents are African Americans from the South Side of Chicago, and they relocated to Compton in 1984 due to his father's affiliation with the Gangster Disciples. Lamar was named after singer-songwriter Eddie Kendricks of the Temptations. He was an only child until the age of seven and was described as a loner by his mother.
Thought: I have information about Kendrick's childhood, but I need to know more about Drake's upbringing to answer the question.
Action: drake_search
Action Input: {'input': "Drake's childhood"}
Observation: Drake was raised in two neighborhoods. He lived on Weston Road in Toronto's working-class west end until grade six and attended Weston Memorial Junior Public School until grade four. He moved to one of the city's affluent neighbourhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000. Drake appeared in a comedic sketch which aired during the 1997 NHL Awards, featuring Martin Brodeur and Ron Hextall. At age 10, he attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute for high school.

Action Input: {'input': "Drake's childhood"}
Observation: Drake was raised in two neighborhoods. He lived on Weston Road in Toronto's working-class west end until grade six and attended Weston Memorial Junior Public School until grade four. He played minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings, reaching the Upper Canada College hockey camp before leaving due to a vicious cross-check to his neck during a game. At age 10, Drake appeared in a comedic sketch which aired during the 1997 NHL Awards.
Thought: I have information about both Kendrick and Drake's childhood, so I can answer the question without using any more tools.
Answer: Kendrick Lamar grew up in Compton, California, as the child of a former gang hustler and a hairdresser, while Drake was raised in two neighborhoods in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and had a brief experience in minor hockey before pursuing a career in entertainment.
