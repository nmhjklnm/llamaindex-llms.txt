# Ollama - Gemma¶
## Setup¶
First, follow the readme to set up and run a local Ollama instance.
Gemma: a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models built by Google DeepMind. Available in 2b and 7b parameter sizes
Ollama: Support both 2b and 7b models
Note: `please install ollama>=0.1.26` You can download pre-release version here Ollama
When the Ollama app is running on your local machine:
  * All of your local models are automatically served on localhost:11434
  * Select your model when setting llm = Ollama(..., model=":")
  * Increase defaullt timeout (30 seconds) if needed setting Ollama(..., request_timeout=300.0)
  * If you set llm = Ollama(..., model="<model family") without a version it will simply look for latest


If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.
