#### Using Your Router¶
A router is a collection of LLMs that you can route queries to. You can create a router in the Neutrino dashboard or use the default router, which includes all supported models. You can treat a router as a LLM.

Optimal model: gpt-3.5-turbo
a subatomic particle that is electrically neutral and has a very small mass. It is one of the fundamental particles that make up the universe. Neutrinos are extremely difficult to detect because they interact very weakly with matter, making them able to pass through most materials without any interaction. They are produced in various natural processes, such as nuclear reactions in the Sun and other stars, as well as in particle interactions on Earth. Neutrinos have played a significant role in advancing our understanding of particle physics and the universe.

assistant:  Statically typed languages and dynamically typed languages are categories of programming languages based on how they handle variable types.

In statically typed languages, the type of a variable is determined at compile-time, which means that the type is checked before the program is run. This ensures that variables are always used in a type-safe manner, preventing many types of errors from occurring at runtime. Examples of statically typed languages include Java, C, C++, and C#.

In dynamically typed languages, the type of a variable is determined at runtime, which means that the type is checked as the program is running. This provides more flexibility, as variables can be assigned values of different types at different times, but it also means that type errors may not be caught until the program is running, which can make debugging more difficult. Examples of dynamically typed languages include Python, Ruby, JavaScript, and PHP.

One key difference between statically typed and dynamically typed languages is that statically typed languages tend to be more verbose, requiring explicit type declarations for variables, while dynamically typed languages are more concise and allow for implicit type declarations. However, this also means that statically typed languages can catch type errors earlier in the
