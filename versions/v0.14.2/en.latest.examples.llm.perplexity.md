# Perplexity¶
Perplexity's Sonar API offers a solution that combines real-time, grounded web search with advanced reasoning and deep research capabilities.
When to use:
  * When your application requires timely, relevant data directly from the web, such as dynamic content updates or current event tracking.
  * For products that need to support complex user queries with integrated reasoning and deep research, like digital assistants or advanced search engines.


Before we get started, make sure you install `llama_index`

## Initial Setup¶
As of April 12th, 2025 - the following models are supported with the Perplexity LLM class in LLaMa Index:
Model | Context Length | Model Type  
---|---|---  
`sonar-deep-research` | 128k | Chat Completion  
`sonar-reasoning-pro` | 128k | Chat Completion  
`sonar-reasoning` | 128k | Chat Completion  
`sonar-pro` | 200k | Chat Completion  
`sonar` | 128k | Chat Completion  
`r1-1776` | 128k | Chat Completion  
  * `sonar-pro` has a max output token limit of 8k.
  * The reasoning models output Chain of Thought responses.
  * `r1-1776` is an offline chat model that does not use the Perplexity search subsystem.

```

## Chat¶
In [ ]:
Copied!
```
response = llm.chat(messages)
print(response)

```

response = llm.chat(messages) print(response)
```
assistant: The latest update on the U.S. stock market indicates a strong performance recently. A significant 10% rally occurred on Wednesday, which contributed substantially to market gains. Additionally, the market closed strongly on Friday, with a 2% increase, ending near the intraday high. This reflects robust momentum, particularly in mega and large-cap growth stocks[1].

```

## Async Chat¶
For asynchronous conversation processing, use the `achat` method to send messages and await the response:
In [ ]:
Copied!
```
# Asynchronously send the list of chat messages to the LLM using the 'achat' method.
# This method returns a ChatResponse object containing the model's answer.
response = await llm.achat(messages)

print(response)

```

# Asynchronously send the list of chat messages to the LLM using the 'achat' method. # This method returns a ChatResponse object containing the model's answer. response = await llm.achat(messages) print(response)
```
assistant: The U.S. stock market has recently experienced significant gains. A major rally on Wednesday resulted in a 10% surge, contributing substantially to the market's overall upside. Additionally, the market closed strongly on Friday, with a 2% increase, ending near the intraday high. This performance highlights robust momentum, particularly in mega-cap and large-cap growth stocks[1].

```

## Stream Chat¶
For cases where you want to receive a response token by token in real time, use the `stream_chat` method:
In [ ]:
Copied!
```
# Call the stream_chat method on the LLM instance, which returns a generator or iterable
# for streaming the chat response one delta (token or chunk) at a time.
response = llm.stream_chat(messages)

# Iterate over each streaming response chunk.
for r in response:
    # Print the delta (the new chunk of generated text) without adding a newline.
    print(r.delta, end="")

```

# Call the stream_chat method on the LLM instance, which returns a generator or iterable # for streaming the chat response one delta (token or chunk) at a time. response = llm.stream_chat(messages) # Iterate over each streaming response chunk. for r in response: # Print the delta (the new chunk of generated text) without adding a newline. print(r.delta, end="")
```
The latest news about the U.S. stock market indicates a strong performance recently. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) experienced a significant rally, with a 10% surge on Wednesday, followed by a 2% gain on Friday. This upward momentum brought the market near its intraday high, driven by strength in mega-cap and large-cap growth stocks[1].
```

## Async Stream Chat¶
Similarly, for asynchronous streaming, the `astream_chat` method provides a way to process response deltas asynchronously:
In [ ]:
Copied!
```
# Asynchronously call the astream_chat method on the LLM instance,
# which returns an asynchronous generator that yields response chunks.
resp = await llm.astream_chat(messages)

# Asynchronously iterate over each response chunk from the generator.
# For each chunk (delta), print the chunk's text content.
async for delta in resp:
    print(delta.delta, end="")

```

# Asynchronously call the astream_chat method on the LLM instance, # which returns an asynchronous generator that yields response chunks. resp = await llm.astream_chat(messages) # Asynchronously iterate over each response chunk from the generator. # For each chunk (delta), print the chunk's text content. async for delta in resp: print(delta.delta, end="")
```
The latest updates on the U.S. stock market indicate significant positive momentum. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) experienced a strong rally, with a notable 10% surge on Wednesday. This was followed by a 2% gain on Friday, closing near the intraday high. The market's performance has been driven by mega and large-cap growth stocks, contributing to the overall upside[1].

### Tool calling¶
Perplexity models can easily be wrapped into a llamaindex tool so that it can be called as part of your data processing or conversational workflows. This tool uses real-time generative search powered by Perplexity, and it’s configured with the updated default model ("sonar-pro") and the enable_search_classifier parameter enabled.
Below is an example of how to define and register the tool:
In [ ]:

```
from llama_index.core.tools import FunctionTool
from llama_index.llms.perplexity import Perplexity
from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage


def query_perplexity(query: str) -> str:
    """

    This function instantiates a Perplexity LLM with updated default settings
    (using model "sonar-pro" and enabling search classifier so that the API can
    intelligently decide if a search is needed), wraps the query into a ChatMessage,
    and returns the generated response content.
    """
    pplx_api_key = (
        "your-perplexity-api-key"  # Replace with your actual API key
    )

    llm = Perplexity(
        api_key=pplx_api_key,
        model="sonar-pro",
        temperature=0.7,
        enable_search_classifier=True,  # This will determine if the search component is necessary in this particular context
    )

    messages = [ChatMessage(role="user", content=query)]
    response = llm.chat(messages)
    return response.message.content
