# Local Llama2 + VectorStoreIndex¶
This notebook walks through the proper setup to use llama-2 with LlamaIndex locally. Note that you need a decent GPU to run this notebook, ideally an A100 with at least 40GB of memory.
Specifically, we look at using a vector store index.
## Setup¶
In [ ]:
Copied!
```
%pip install llama-index-llms-huggingface
%pip install llama-index-embeddings-huggingface

```

%pip install llama-index-llms-huggingface %pip install llama-index-embeddings-huggingface
In [ ]:

```
!pip install llama-index ipywidgets

```

!pip install llama-index ipywidgets
### Set Up¶
**IMPORTANT** : Please sign in to HF hub with an account that has access to the llama2 models, using `huggingface-cli login` in your console. For more details, please see: https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/.

**Growing up, the author wrote short stories, programmed on an IBM 1401, and eventually convinced his father to buy him a TRS-80 microcomputer. He wrote simple games, a program to predict how high his model rockets would fly, and a word processor. He studied philosophy in college, but eventually switched to AI. He wrote essays and published them online, and worked on spam filters and painting. He also hosted dinners for a group of friends every Thursday night and bought a building in Cambridge.**

```
At Interleaf, a group of people worked on projects for customers. One of the employees told the narrator about a new thing called HTML, which was a derivative of SGML. The narrator left Interleaf to pursue art school at RISD, but continued to do freelance work for the group. Eventually, the narrator and two of his friends, Robert and Trevor, started a new company called Viaweb to create a web app that allowed users to build stores through the browser. They opened for business in January 1996 with 6 stores. The software had three main parts: the editor, the shopping cart, and the manager.

Streamed output at 26.923490295496002 tokens/s
